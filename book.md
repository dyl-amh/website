Survivalism for Hedonists is a collection of poetic experiments, using digital randomization and cut-up techniques to explore how exploding language might move us closer to representing cataclysmic life events—and how we survive them.

“Dylan McNulty-Holmes has a great flair for the intimate, the ribald and the immediately arresting. Observant, sensuous and layered, his words reveal an original mind at work.”
*—Leon Craig, author of Parallel Hells*

“These poems vibrate with unruly bodies, quiet furies, and queer & trans desires. The result is both a tender homage to his own lineage as an artist and a radical vision of a future imbued with hope.”
*—Jane Flett, author of Mashnotes*

“Lyrically prismatic poems that are tenderhearted, fierce, vulnerable, and exposed.”
*—Sara Larsen, author of Detonated Mirror*

“Even in moments of melancholy, Survivalism for Hedonists is romantic as romantic can be, drawing on radiant colors to produce emotionally tangible scenes in every piece.”
*—nat raum, author of preparatory school for the end of the world*
